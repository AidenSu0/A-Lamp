# A-Lamp

Implementation of the paper: A-Lamp: Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Photo Aesthetic Assessment

The work is split up in 3 main parts :
  * Multi-Patch Subnet : 
      * Adaptive Patch Selection 
      * Orderless Aggregation layer 
  * Layout Aware Subnet 
  
In addition, is included the Exploratory Data Analysis of the AVA Dataset.
